# ArborView

An interactive web-based visualization tool for CART decision trees built with R's `rpart` package. ArborView exports rpart models to JSON and renders them in the browser using D3.js, making it easy to explore and communicate tree structure, node statistics, and variable importance.

**Live demo:** https://arborview-delta.vercel.app/

## Features

- Interactive hierarchical tree layout powered by D3.js
- Node sizing proportional to sample count
- Hover tooltips with per-node statistics
- Decision path breadcrumb — rules from root to any selected node
- Detail panel showing impurity, complexity, deviance, and class probabilities
- Variable importance chart
- Model performance panel with confusion matrix and classification statistics (accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, specificity, PPV/NPV, balanced accuracy)
- Support for both classification (Gini) and regression (MSE) trees
- Dataset selector for comparing multiple models

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v18+) and npm
- **R** with packages: `rpart`, `jsonlite`, `partykit`

## Installing Node.js and npm

npm is bundled with Node.js. Install Node.js (v18+) for your platform:

### Mac

```bash
brew install node
```

If Homebrew is not installed, get it at https://brew.sh first. Alternatively, download the macOS installer directly from https://nodejs.org.

### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

Then close and reopen Command Prompt so `node` and `npm` are on your PATH. Alternatively, download the Windows installer from https://nodejs.org and run it.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

Then close and reopen PowerShell so `node` and `npm` are on your PATH. Alternatively, download the Windows installer from https://nodejs.org and run it.

Verify the install on any platform:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Adding Rscript to PATH

`Rscript` is installed with R and is needed when exporting a model from the command line. Verify that it is already available:

```bash
Rscript --version
```

If that command is not found, add the directory containing `Rscript.exe` to your PATH. On Windows, it is usually in a versioned R install directory such as:

```text
C:\Program Files\R\R-4.x.x\bin
```

If you are not sure which version is installed, locate it from PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\R" -Recurse -Filter Rscript.exe
```

Then add the `bin` directory to your user PATH:

1. Open Start and search for **Edit environment variables for your account**.
2. Select **Environment Variables**, then under **User variables** select `Path` and choose **Edit**.
3. Choose **New** and add the R `bin` directory, for example `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.x.x\bin`.
4. Select **OK** to save, then close and reopen your terminal.

Verify the update:

```powershell
Rscript --version
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### 1. Export a model from R

```r
source("R/export_tree.R")

fit <- rpart::rpart(Class ~ ., data = mydata)
arborview_export(fit, "public/data/my_model.json", title = "My Model")
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
Rscript R/export_tree.R model.rds public/data/my_model.json "My Model"
```

Then add an entry for your file in `public/data/manifest.json`.

### 1b. Add model performance (optional)

If you have a `caret::confusionMatrix()` performance report saved as a `.txt` file, patch it into the exported JSON:

```bash
Rscript R/add_performance.R path/to/performance.txt public/data/my_model.json
```

This adds a `performance` field to the JSON in place. The model performance panel in the sidebar will then show the confusion matrix and classification statistics. Datasets without a performance file simply show a placeholder message.

### 2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript and bundle for production |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |

## JSON Schema

`arborview_export()` writes a single JSON file per model. Here is what each part of that file contains.

### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | string | Always `"arborview/tree@1"`. Used to detect version mismatches. |
| `title` | string | Human-readable label shown in the dataset dropdown. |
| `method` | string | rpart method string: `"class"` (classification) or `"anova"` (regression). |
| `response.type` | string | `"classification"` or `"regression"`. |
| `response.levels` | string array or null | Ordered class labels for classification trees; `null` for regression. Index `i` in this array corresponds to index `i` in each node's `class_counts` and `class_probs`. |
| `variables.predictors` | string array | Names of all predictor variables from the model formula. |
| `variables.importance` | object | Variable importance scores from rpart (higher = more important). Keys are predictor names; values are raw importance scores. |
| `cptable` | array or absent | One row per tree size evaluated during cross-validation. Each row has `CP`, `nsplit`, `rel_error`, `xerror`, `xstd`. Useful for plotting the bias-variance tradeoff and choosing a pruning level. |
| `call` | string | The original R call that produced the model, e.g. `"rpart(y ~ x1 + x2)"`. |
| `tree` | object | Root node of the tree. Children are nested recursively (see below). |
| `performance` | object or absent | Whole-tree classification statistics from `caret::confusionMatrix()`, added by `R/add_performance.R`. See below. |

### Node fields

Every node — whether a leaf or an internal split — has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `node_id` | integer | rpart's integer node ID. Root = 1; left child of node `k` = `2k`; right child = `2k+1`. |
| `depth` | integer | Distance from root (root = 0, root's children = 1, …). |
| `n` | integer | Number of training observations that reached this node. |
| `weight` | number | Sum of case weights at this node. Equals `n` when no case weights were used. |
| `deviance` | number | Total deviance at this node (impurity × n). For classification: weighted Gini × n. For regression: residual sum of squares. |
| `complexity` | number | Cost-complexity parameter (alpha) at which this node would be pruned. Smaller = more stable split. |
| `is_leaf` | boolean | `true` for terminal leaves, `false` for internal split nodes. |
| `impurity` | number | Per-observation impurity. Classification: Gini index (1 − Σpᵢ²). Regression: MSE (deviance / n). |
| `rule_from_root` | string array | Plain-English decision rules from the root down to (but not including) this node. Empty for the root itself. Example: `["age < 12.5", "income >= 50000"]`. |

**Classification-only fields** (present when `response.type == "classification"`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `predicted_class` | string | Majority-class label at this node. |
| `class_counts` | integer array | Raw observation counts per class. Order matches `response.levels`. |
| `class_probs` | number array | Proportion of observations per class. Order matches `response.levels`. Sums to 1. |
| `node_prob` | number | Fraction of the entire training set that reached this node. |

**Regression-only fields** (present when `response.type == "regression"`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `predicted_value` | number | Mean response value for observations at this node. |

**Internal-node-only fields** (present when `is_leaf == false`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `split_var` | string | Name of the predictor variable used to split at this node. |
| `split` | object | The split condition (see below). |
| `children` | array | Two-element array: `[left_child, right_child]`, each a full node object. |

### Split objects

A numeric split (e.g. `age < 12.5`):

```json
{
  "type": "numeric",
  "threshold": 12.5,
  "left_op": "<",
  "right_op": ">="
}
```

A categorical split (e.g. `region ∈ {West, South}`):

```json
{
  "type": "categorical",
  "left_levels": ["West", "South"],
  "right_levels": ["East", "Midwest"]
}
```

`left_levels` and `right_levels` are the factor levels routed to each child. Levels absent from both sets were `NA` in the training data.

### Performance object

Present only when `R/add_performance.R` has been run. Parsed from `caret::confusionMatrix()` text output.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `positive_class` | string | The class designated as "positive" by caret. |
| `confusion_matrix.labels` | string array | Class labels; order matches `matrix` rows and columns. |
| `confusion_matrix.matrix` | number[][] | Confusion matrix where `matrix[i][j]` = count predicted as `labels[i]`, true class `labels[j]`. Rows = predicted, columns = reference. |
| `accuracy` | number | Overall fraction of correct predictions. |
| `accuracy_ci` | [number, number] | 95% confidence interval for accuracy. |
| `kappa` | number | Cohen's kappa — agreement above chance. |
| `no_information_rate` | number | Accuracy achieved by always predicting the majority class. |
| `sensitivity` | number | True positive rate for the positive class. |
| `specificity` | number | True negative rate for the positive class. |
| `ppv` | number | Positive predictive value (precision). |
| `npv` | number | Negative predictive value. |
| `prevalence` | number | Fraction of the test set belonging to the positive class. |
| `detection_rate` | number | Fraction of the test set correctly identified as the positive class. |
| `detection_prevalence` | number | Fraction of the test set predicted as the positive class. |
| `balanced_accuracy` | number | Average of sensitivity and specificity. |

### Manifest

`public/data/manifest.json` is a simple index of available datasets:

```json
{
  "datasets": [
    { "id": "my_model", "label": "My Model", "file": "my_model.json" }
  ]
}
```

`file` is the filename relative to `public/data/`.
